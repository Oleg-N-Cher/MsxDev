Introduction Turbo Pascal version 3.3.

This file was created March 1995.

In this textfile will you find some information about the new
version of turbo pascal version 3.3  (from here on shorted as
TP33) for MSXcomputers. This version will be released on the
fair in Tilburg 8 april 1995.  

TP33 is a complete rebuild pascal compiler for msx computers.
It is a command line compiler which include all previous
features from version 3.0a but also much new featers like:

1. 32 bit signed-integer calculations.
2. full graphics mode support.
3. full sprite support.
4. mapper support through MEMMAN (tsr compatible)
5. overlay routines linked with mapper routines.
6. use of dos routines instead of cp/m routines.

In advance of all this the routines for real calculations are
speeded up (up to 25%), and also integer calculations are
improved. If this isn't enough, the compiler itself is also
faster. 

If you don't believe all of this above, then you can take a
look at the stand of MSX COMPUTER CLUB ENSCHEDE (stand nr 406
& 407) at the fair in Tilburg 8 april 1995. 


The price is only Ÿ40.=  (40 dutch guilders ex p&p)

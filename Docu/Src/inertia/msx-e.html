        Welcome, brave visitor. In this page you will find my software productions for MSX
        computers (well, not all of them, but the ones that are worth using), useful mainly
        for programmers of such obsolete system. And of course, all for free (freeware,
        do-whatever-you-want-with-it-ware, etc), since as Linus Torvalds said once:</p>
    <p>
        <cite>"Software is like sex: it is much better when it is for free"</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
        So go for it, download everything you want and for any comment, suggestion or complaint
        write me to the e-mail address that appears at the beginning of the page.

    <fieldset>
        <legend>About text files (spanish versions only)</legend>
        <p>
            All the text files contained in this page are stored in MSX-DOS format, AKA MS-DOS
            format or OEM format. Therefore, if you try to open any of these files with Notepad
            or other similar program and the file is in spanish, you will not be able to correctly
            see the special characters like "&aacute;", "&ntilde;", etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution: view the text files from your MSX (that's what the files are intended
            for), or with MS-DOS' EDIT, or use any programa capable of converting from DOS format
            to ANSI format (the format used by Windows). For this purpose I recommend <a href="http://www.editpadlite.com">
                EditPad Lite</a>; it is a simple yet powerful text editor, free for non-cummercial
            use. In the <em>Convert</em> menu of this program, the option <em>OEM -&gt; ANSI</em>
            will do the conversion we are interested in.

        <legend>Why am I asking for donations?</legend>
        <p>
            I develop MSX software for fun. If people uses my software and every now and then someone says something like
            "Hey I liked that NestorFoobar thing, good work!",
            I consider myself rewarded enough, and this is not going to change anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, receiving even a small amount of economic support would be a big help for me. You know,
            I develop in my free time and sometimes my wife sees me and asks
            <i>"Why do you continue developing for a completely obsolete system that nobody uses anymore?"</i>.
            It would be really great and fulfilling if I could answer <b>"But look, honey, I am earning money with this!"</b>
            instead of nodding in shame. You know what I mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh, and I would probably use the money to buy shoes for my kids. I don't know what these boys do with the shoes,
            but they completely rip apart a pair every two or three months. It's scary.

    <!-- Nextor -->
    
    <hr />
    <h2 id="nextor">
        Nextor
    </h2>
    <p>
        Nextor is a disk operating system for MSX computers. It is actually an enhanced version of MSX-DOS, with which it is 100% compatible,
        and it identifies itself as MSX-DOS 2.31 to MSX-DOS aware applications.
    </p>
    <p>The main features that Nextor adds to MSX-DOS are:</p>
 
    <ul id="NextorFeatures">
        <li><strong>Native support for the FAT16 filesystem.</strong> Nextor can handle the FAT16 filesystem
            without having to install any patch or additional software. This raises the maximum size
            of usable filesystems from the 32MB supported by FAT12 to 4GB. Also, the system can boot from a FAT16 filesystem.</li>
        <li><strong>New, fully documented device driver system.</strong> Developers of driver software
            for massive storage devices no longer need to reverse-engineer the operating system kernel ROM
            (or to follow the steps of someone that has done it in the past) in order to
            generate a kernel ROM with the custom driver code embedded on it. Nextor provides an enhanced
            driver system and the steps needed to integrate it within the kernel ROM are fully documented.
            Furthermore, Nextor drivers have extra extensibility points (for BASIC &quot;CALL&quot; commands or 
            extended BIOS, for instance).</li>
        <li><strong>Device and partition to drive mapping management.</strong> When using the device driver
            system designed for Nextor, it is the operating system itself who manages the logical drive to physical
            storage device mapping, including the partition selection. Nextor drivers simply enumerate the
            available devices and provide access to the raw device sectors.</li>
        <li><strong>Built-in device partitioning tool.</strong> Just go to the BASIC prompt, invoke a
            CALL FDISK command, and you are ready to create partitions on any device controlled by
            a Nextor driver.</li>
        <li><strong>Embedded MSX-DOS 1 kernel.</strong> The Nextor kernel will boot in MSX-DOS 1 mode
            when the computer has no mapped RAM, when the &quot;1&quot; key is pressed at boot time,
            or when a MSX-DOS 1 boot sector is detected in the boot device. There is no need to have a MSX-DOS 1
            kernel in another slot (for example in a floppy disk driver controller), and you can use
            partitions with a size of up to 16MB contained on any device controlled by a Nextor driver. </li>
	<li><strong>Works on MSX1.</strong> Nextor works on all MSX computers, including MSX1.
            Of course mapped memory is needed for normal operation, but even without it, MSX1 computers
            can use Nextor in MSX-DOS 1 mode.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are other nice features as well, please read the <a href="#NextorUserManual">Nextor user manual</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have used FDISK in Nextor 2.0.2 or earlier, or in Nextor 2.1 Alpha 1, please take a look
    at the <a href="#vsft">Volume Size Fix Tool</a>.</p>
    <p/>
    <fieldset>
        <legend id="Legend1">Note for Sunrise IDE owners</legend>
        <p>
            If you want to flash the Nextor kernel ROM in a Sunrise IDE or Sunrise CF reader cartridge, you can't use the IDEFLOAD.COM
            tool supplied with the hardware, because this tool assumes that the ROM file to be burned is 64K long but the Nextor kernel
            is 128K long. Instead, you must use IDEFL128.COM, a modified version of the tool that assumes the ROM file to be 128K long instead.
            You can find the IDEFL128.COM tool in the <a href="#idefl128">miscellaneous</a> section.
        </p>
        <p>
            The author of both the original IDEFLOAD tool and the modified IDEFL128 is Jon De Schrijder. I want to thank him
            for developing the modified version at my request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, note that the Sunrise IDE driver supplied with Nextor 2.0 is an experimental driver that has some limitations, more precisely:
        </p>
        <ul class="fileList">
            <li>Only LBA mode block devices are supported, there is no support for CHS or ATAPI devices.</li>
            <li>Devices are reported as fixed by the driver. If you are using a CF card reader and you want to change the card(s), you must switch off your computer; hot swapping of cards is not supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The source code of the Sunrise IDE driver for Nextor <a href="#sunride-driver">is available for download</a>
            in case you want to take a look and suggest improvements (which would be highly welcome).
        </p>
    </fieldset>
    <p/>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>Note for openMSX users</legend>
        <p>
            Starting at version 2.0.1 Nextor works with the openMSX emulator. Previous versions did not work due to
            a bug in the kernel boot code.

        NestorBASIC
    </h2>
    <p>
        NestorBASIC is a BASIC extension for MSX2/2+/TR computers with at least 128K mapped
        RAM. It is Turbo-BASIC compatible (in fact it includes Turbo-BASIC, an loads it
        at installation time) and provides the following capabilities:
    </p>
    <ul id="NestorBasicFeatures">
        <li><strong>Access to all the mapped memory available on the computer</strong> (all
            the free memory when using DOS 2)<strong>, up to 4 Mb.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Full access to VRAM,</strong> including data blocks exchange between RAM
            and VRAM.</li>
        <li><strong>BASIC programs storage in mapped memory,</strong> it is possible to switch
            from one to another without losing the existing variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Disk files and sectors access, </strong>it is possible to directly read/write
            to/from mapped memory and VRAM. <strong>File searching, directories management.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Graphic compression/decompresion.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>MoonBlaster music replay. Samplekit and wavekit load.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>PSG sound effects replay.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Machine code routines execution; </strong>routines placed in BIOS, in a
            mapped memory segment or in BASIC main memory (including system work area) can be
            executed <strong>directly or using interrupts.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>NestorMan functions, InterNestor Suite and InterNestor Lite routines execution.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        NestorBASIC consists on a single file which can be installed with a simple BLOAD
        instruction. It installs itself on a hidden RAM segment and only uses about 500
        bytes of the BASIC main memory. Its functions are invoked using an USR instruction
        and an array for the parameters, so they can be used from inside of turbo-blocks.
        Turbo-BASIC is included within the NestorBASIC file, both are installed simultaneously.
    </p>
    <fieldset>
        <legend>A scary story</legend>
        <p>
            NestorBASIC 1.0 release date is july 2003, whilst the last beta, version 0.07, was
            released in july 1998. Yes, the NestorBASIC project has remained abandoned for exactly
            five years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The story is as follows. In 1998 a technical failure (the SCSI cable I used those
            days was bullshit) caused a crash in my computer, and when restarting I discovered
            that the FAT of the hard disk partition where my programs were stored was completely
            smashed. With a lot of patience and a sectors editor I could recover almost all
            of the source codes, but one of the lost ones was NestorBASIC.
        </p>
        <p>
            And you may ask: "But you hadn't any backup copy?" Yes, I had the NestorBASIC directory
            mirrored in another partition of the hard disk... but it was version 0.06, and a
            lot of changes were made when stepping to version 0.07. So, since NestorBASIC 0.07
            was already quite complete, I decided to abandon the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            And time passed... until may 2003. While I was looking at Kyoko playing Bubble Rain,
            I began to think: "It is really a nice game, and the best part is that it uses NestorBASIC,
            what a pity that I lost the source code... it is the only of my programs that are
            used regularly by other MSX users (more or less), if I could only recover it and
            improve it a little... blah blah..."
        </p>
        <p>
            So I took a crazy decision: I would dissassemble NestorBASIC 0.07 and, comparing
            the result with the sources of version 0.06, I would rebuild the lost sources and
            from that point I would make version 1.0. And I really did it: one month of hard
            work later, NestorBASIC 1.0 was released, with a lot of failures corrected and with
            support for InterNestor Suite.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that it was worth the effort, and that soon MSX programmers around the world
            will develop a lot of games and internet applications using NestorBASIC (well, just
            daydreaming).

    <p>
        One of the capabilities of NestorBASIC is the possibility of executing machine code
        routines previously loaded on any memory segment. Using this mechanism it is possible
        to develop extensions for tasks that are impossible to do when using only BASIC
        instructions or NestorBASIC functions. In this section you have all the extensions
        I have developped for NestorBASIC, all of them include usage manual and an usage
        example.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="listTitle"><a href="nbasic/cabropl4.lzh">CABROPL4.LZH</a>:</span> Allows direct
            control of MoonSound's sound chip OPL4, without having to use the MoonBlaster driver.</li>
        <li><span class="listTitle"><a href="nbasic/nmif.lzh">NMIF.LZH</a>:</span> <strong>NestorMIF</strong>
            allows the decompression of MIF format graphic files previously loaded on mapped

        <li><span class="listTitle"><a href="nbasic/ncads.lzh">NCADS.LZH</a>:</span> <strong>NestorCadenas.</strong>
            This extension is useful for programs that use a lot of text strings. Now you can
            store all the strings in a text file, load this file on mapped memory, and by using
            NestorCadenas retrieve the strings when you need them. You can retrieve the strings
            sequentially (in the same order they are stored in the file) or randomly (identifying
            the strings with a name). The advantage is clear: if the strings are stored in mapped
            memory, more main memory is available for the BASIC program.</li>

        NestorPreTer
    </h2>
    <p>
        When writing MSX-BASIC programas we encounter three problems. First, the comments
        we add to the code use part of the scare memory available for the program. Second,
        variable names can have only two characters, which does not help to add readability
        to the program. And third, jumps and subroutine calls refer to line number, which
        also makes the program to be difficult to trace.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>NestorPreTer</strong>, which works in MSX2/2+/TR with at least 128K mapped
        RAM, helps to solve these problems. It is a BASIC pre-interpreter, that is, a utility
        that converts a text file into an MSX-BASIC executable program; this text file may
        be generated with a text editor or in the MSX-BASIC environment, saving the program
        in ASCII format (SAVE"PROGRAM.BAS",A). The processing performed by NestorPreTer
        on the "source" file is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remarks and blank spaces stripping.</strong> You can add to your "source"
            as many comments and indentations as you want, the amount of memory used by your
            program will be only the amount needed to store the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Line numbers generation.</strong> It is not necessary to type line numbers
            in the code, since NestorPreTer will generate them automatically. To identify the
            lines that are destination for jump instructions, you can use alphanumeric labels.</li>
        <li><strong>Macro expansion.</strong> You can define macros, that is, text blocks with
            an assigned name (similar to DEFINE directive of the C language). This allows the
            simulation of long names for variables, for example you can include "@DEFINE FILE_NAME
            F$" at the beginning of the text, and then use "INPUT @FILE_NAME" within the code.</li>

        128K RAM. It supports two kinds of hardware: serial port (RS232) with modem,
        and the <a href="#unapi">Ethernet UNAPI</a>.</p>

        <p>
        InterNestor Lite implements the <a href="#tcpipunapi">TCP/IP UNAPI</a> specification, therefore you can use
        it to run the software in the <a href="#networking">networking applications</a> section.</p>

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> InterNestor Lite requires the UNAPI RAM helper in order to be installed.</p>

        <legend>Note about MSX trivial tweeter user authorization</legend>
            <p>Before the application can send tweets on your behalf,
            you will need access to a computer with a web browser in order to perform an authorization process; this must be done only once
            per Twitter account.</p>
            <p>It works this way: MSX trivial tweeter will connect to Twitter in order to get a temporary authorization token. Then, it will
            display you a long and ugly URL that you must type on the address bar of a web browser. From here, you confirm
            that you authorize MSX trivial tweeter to tweet on your behalf. You get then a PIN code, that you must type on your MSX.</p>
            <p>It is not my fault. The OAuth protocol is quite cumbersome on non-web based Twitter clients.</p>

        <legend>Note about MSX trivial dropbox</legend>
            <p>Starting at version 1.1, MSX trivial dropbox is no longer a standalone application. It uses Dropbox API v1,
            which requires mandatory usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol_Secure">HTTPS</a>. MSX computers can't currently handle HTTPS
            (or any other protocol on top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a>), therefore it is necessary to use a proxy (located in another computer)
            to convert plain TCP to SSL and the other way around 
            (an example of such proxy is <a href="https://www.stunnel.org">stunnel</a>).
            Please read the MSX trivial dropbox user manual for details.</p>

            <p>Also, as in the case of MSX trivial tweeter, a one-time authorization process with the involvement a web browser is needed

    Version 1.x is discontinued.</p>
    <p>Starting at version 2.0, InterNestor Lite implements the TCP/IP UNAPI specification and is not compatible with versions 1.x: networking applications targetting the

    <p>
        NestorMan is a dynamic memory manager for MSX2/2+/TR with MSX-DOS 2. It installs
        as a TSR, so it may be used by any other application. NestorMan offers the following
        capabilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Reservation of memory blocks with sizes between 1 byte and 16K.</em> This mechanism
            is much more versatile than the one provided by DOS 2, which only allows the allocation
            of whole 16K segments. After asking NestorMan for a new block of the desired size,
            it returns the number of the segment where the block has been reserved, as well
            as its starting address. NestorMan automatically handles the allocation of new segments
            when they are needed.</li>
        <li><em>Double-chained lists creation.</em> These lists are data structures in which
            each item is stored with a pointer to the previous item and a pointer to the next
            item. It is possible to insert items (any data block with a size of up to 16K) and
            to extract them to/from any position on the list, as well as to "browse" the items
            (to move to the previous or to the next item, or to move to a given item providing
            his index number in the list).</li>

        SDCC libraries
    </h2>

    <p>SDCC stands for <em>Small Devices C Compiler</em>. It is a free C language
           cross-compiler available for Windows and Linux platforms, targetting the Z80 processor among others. SDCC can be obtained at
           <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net">the SDCC project page</a>; more information and resources about
           development of MSX applications using SDCC is available at <a href="http://msx.atlantes.org/index_en.html">
           Avelino Herrera's MSX page</a>.</p>

    <p>In this section you can find some libraries that can be useful when developing MSX applications with SDCC.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><span class="listTitle"><a href="sdcc/msxchar.lib">MSXCHAR</a>: Standard C console functions for MSX.</span>
    This library contains MSX-DOS compatible
    versions of the standard C functions <em>getchar</em>, <em>putchar</em> and <em>printf</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <fieldset>
        <legend>About the console functions and the standard Z80 library</legend>
        <p>
            SDCC comes with a Z80 version of the standard C library, it is at <em>(SDCC folder)\lib\z80\z80.lib</em>.
            The versions of the console related functions <em>getchar</em>, <em>putchar</em>
            and <em>printf</em> that are bundled in this library are not suited for developing MSX software. The
            logical fix for this would be to replace these functions with MSX compatible versions
            inside the library itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            However there is a problem with the current version of SDCC, at least the Windows version: it is not possible
            to manage the file <em>z80.lib</em> with the SDCC library manager utility supplied,
            <em>sdcclib.exe</em>. If attempted, the error message "File was not created with
            sdcclib" is displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The workaround I have come up with consists of using the msxchar library that you
            can download here, plus modifying the original file <em>z80.lib</em> by hand (this
            is necessary so that the compiler does not complaint about having duplicate function
            names). That's how this can be done:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <em>z80.lib</em> file in a text editor. You will see garbage (binary data)
                mixed with text data.</li>
            <li>Search for all the occurences of the names <strong>printf</strong>, <strong>getchar</strong>
                and <strong>putchar</strong> within the file, either as whole words or as part of
                other words.</li>
            <li>Modify these names while maintaining their lengths. I have simply changed the first
                character into a 'x', so that they become 'xrintf', 'xetchar' and 'xutchar'.</li>
            </ol>
        <p>This is not a perfect solution but it seems to work. If anyone knows a better way for dealing
        with this apparently defective <em>z80.lib</em>, please let me know.</p>

    <!-- MSX-UNAPI -->
    
    <hr />
    <h2 id="unapi">
        MSX-UNAPI specification
    </h2>
    <p><em>See also the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/unapi">UNAPI project site on SourceForge.net</a>.</em></p>
    <p>
        MSX-UNAPI stands for <em>MSX unified API definition and discovery standard</em>.
        It is a proposal of a coding standard aimed to hardware and software developers.</p>
    <p>
        When MSX hobbyists develop new hardware for MSX machines, they equip the devices
        with a ROM containing code that provides an API (Application Program Interface),
        a set of routines that are used by software applications in order to access the
        hardware. How this API is designed and implemented depends only on the hardware
        developer criteria, since there is not a standarized way to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The MSX-UNAPI specification aims to provide a standarized way to <em>define, implement,
            discover and use</em> such APIs, so that devices with the same function made
        by different developers may have compatible APIs.
    </p>
    <fieldset>
    <legend>What's new in version 1.1</legend>
    <p>Now the UNAPI specification offers support for <em>specificationless applications</em>,
    that is, sotware applications that do not conform to any API standard but that make use of the remaining
    infrastructure offered by the UNAPI standard, especially the discovery procedure and the RAM helper.
    An example of specificationless application is a TSR that installs on a RAM segment.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, the RAM helper has been improved: it now offers a routine that allows calling an address on a RAM segment
    (not any address, but a predefined set of 64 addresses) with only five bytes of code. This allows to patch hooks
    so that they invoke code on a RAM segment without having to allocate space on page 3 (apart from the space for the
    RAM helper itself, which is installed only once).
    </p>
    <p>Finally, installing the RAM helper is no longer mandatory for RAM based implementations: they have the option to
    refuse to install instead if no RAM helper is already installed.</p>
        </fieldset>
    <p>
        It is easier than it seems (really!) and it can be really useful for hardware and
        software developers. If you are interested, here are the available documents

    <legend>Ethernet vs TCP/IP UNAPIs</legend>
    <p>Developers of networking hardware (or rather, developers of BIOS software for networking hardware) can now choose
    between implementing the Ethernet UNAPI specification or the TCP/IP UNAPI specification.
    </p>
    <p>
    Implementing the Ethernet UNAPI specification is simple and straighforward (there are just a few routines to implement)
    and is the best option when using simple hardware that cannot process TCP/IP by itself. However, in order to use networking software
    a TCP/IP stack such as <a href="#inl2">InterNestor Lite</a> must be installed, which places the TCP/IP processing burden 
    on the MSX itself.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, implementing the TCP/IP UNAPI specification requires more work, but is the best option for complex
    hardware with embedded TCP/IP capabilities. In this case, no separate TCP/IP stack installation is required,
    and networking applications can be used right away.</p>
    <p>Please take a look at the <a href="#inl2">InterNestor Lite</a> section and the <a href="#networking">networking software</a> section
    to find applications that make use of these specifications.</p>
